## x) Read and summarize

1) A01:2021 Broken Access Control
   - Broken Access control is a thing that happens when a system does not properly restrict what users are allowed to do. If it happens then atatckers have the ability view, modify, or delete data they should not have access to.
   - This is important as its found in 94% of tested applications. It can also lead to Data breaches and Financial frauds.
   - Example attacks; 

If the website uses a URL like: /account?acct=12345

An attacker might change it to: /account?acct=54321

- It can be prevented by taking some measures for example enforce access control on the server side, using deny by default and applying least privilege principle.

Key insight and takeaway

* Access control must be designed properly, enforced consistently and last but not least tested regularly.

2) A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration

   - Security Misconfiguration happens when systems are not securely configured. This includes default settings, unnecessary features, and weak permissions.
   - Its serious because it’s found in about 90% of tested applications and has over 208,000 occurrences.
   - Common Misconfiguration Examples: default passwords still enabled, admin consoles left exposed, and missing security headers etc.
   - This can be prevented by doing some simple things like remove unnecessary features and services, change default passwords and keep software updated.

Key insight and takeaway
   - Security misconfiguration is dangerous because it is often accidental and overlooked. Attackers dont need skills but they just look for mistakes.

3) A06:2021 Vulnerable and Outdated Components

    - This is about the components (libraries, frameworks, servers, APIs, OS, etc.) that contain known vulnerabilities or are no longer maintained. If even one is vulnerable, your whole application can be compromised.
    - Its dangerous because we are likely vulnerable if: we don’t know what versions of libraries we use or we don’t track nested dependencies and dont check for CVEs.
