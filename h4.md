## x) Read and summarize

1) A01:2021 Broken Access Control
   - Broken Access control is a thing that happens when a system does not properly restrict what users are allowed to do. If it happens then atatckers have the ability view, modify, or delete data they should not have access to.
   - This is important as its found in 94% of tested applications. It can also lead to Data breaches and Financial frauds.
   - Example attacks; 

If the website uses a URL like: /account?acct=12345

An attacker might change it to: /account?acct=54321

- It can be prevented by taking some measures for example enforce access control on the server side, using deny by default and applying least privilege principle.

Key insight and takeaway

* Access control must be designed properly, enforced consistently and last but not least tested regularly.

2) A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration

   - Security Misconfiguration happens when systems are not securely configured. This includes default settings, unnecessary features, and weak permissions.
   - Its serious because it’s found in about 90% of tested applications and has over 208,000 occurrences.
   - Common Misconfiguration Examples: default passwords still enabled, admin consoles left exposed, and missing security headers etc.
   - This can be prevented by doing some simple things like remove unnecessary features and services, change default passwords and keep software updated.

Key insight and takeaway
   - Security misconfiguration is dangerous because it is often accidental and overlooked. Attackers dont need skills but they just look for mistakes.

3) A06:2021 Vulnerable and Outdated Components

    - This is about the components (libraries, frameworks, servers, APIs, OS, etc.) that contain known vulnerabilities or are no longer maintained. If even one is vulnerable, your whole application can be compromised.
    - Its dangerous because we are likely vulnerable if: we don’t know what versions of libraries we use or we don’t track nested dependencies and dont check for CVEs.
    - Tools like Shodan help attackers find systems still vulnerable to old issues
    - It can be prevented if organizations; maintain a complete inventory of components Use tools like the OWASP Dependency Check and monitor CVE and NVD databases etc.

Key insight and takeaway

- if you dont update your system slowly becomes easier to attack.

4) A03:2021 Injection

   -  Injection usually happens when an application treats user input as code or commands.
   -  So if input is not separated from system commands, an attacker can inject instructions.
   -  It is found in 94% of tested applications and can lead to Data theft, data modification, and even full system takeover.
   -  To Prevent Injection, use parameterized queries, avoid dynamic query construction and security testing. 

Key insights and takeaways

- Never mix user input with system commands! Fun fact, Injection is one of the oldest vulnerabilities.

5) xkcd 327: Exploits of a Mom

   - The comics tell why you must sanitize input and why you should use parameterized queries.
   - In the comic when they insert the student's name the database thinks it is a command and deletes the entire student table.
  
Key insights and takeaways

- how bad small mistake of input handling can let someone delete your whole database.

Part e) Solve Portswigger Labs
- When i click on a product category and add a `to the url it gives an an Internal Server Error, It confirms that your input successfully "broke" the back end SQL query, proving the parameter is vulnerable.
