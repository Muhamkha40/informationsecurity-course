# Intrusion Kill Chain
* The intrusion kill chain is a systematic model adapted from military doctrine, perhaps to identify and prevent cyber intrusions. It basically has 7 phases in it's model. These are as follows:

1) Reconnaissance: Researching and choosing targets.

2) Weaponization: Coupling an exploit into a payload.

3) Delivery: Transmitting the weapon.

4) Exploitation: Triggering the intruder’s code by using leverage.

5) Installation: Installing a backdoor to maintain persistence.

6) Command and Control (C2): Establishing a remote "hands on keyboard" channel.

7) Actions on Objectives: Can do whatever want and fulfill intital goals.

# a) Tactics, tools and procedures 
* Define tactic and give an example of a specific tactic

It emphasises the "why" of an action. It represents the adversary’s tactical goal and for example; adversary might adversary wants to gather information for their future operations. 

* Define technique and subtechnique, and give an example of each

Technique relates to the "how" an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. E.g) to create an account, it would create a new user account to achieve persistence.

Sub technique have more narrow down description. Example includes adversary putting credentials by accessing the Local Security Authority. 

* Define procedure, and give an example of each.

this is a specific implementation of how an adversary executed a technique or sub-technique and these are categorized in ATT&CK. Example is
An adversary sending a phishing email to a target company containing a hidden link to a site that automatically downloads a ZIP file.
