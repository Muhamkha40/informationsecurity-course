# Threat modeling summary
1)  Braiterman et al 2020

i) Threat modeling is basically analysing systems and asking 4 main questions to identify if there are any security or privacy risks. 

ii) Use of threat modeling manifesto is important as it provides with guiding values and princples. Value would be something that has signficance and priciples are the facts about 
    threat modeling (there are 3 types of principles in question). 
    
iv) Things that will benefit threat modeling are; Systematic approach, Varied viewpoints, and putting theory into practise etc. These anti patterns should be avoided; Admiring the problem, and having Tendency to Overfocus etc. 

iii) Idea: New people to threat modeling could learnt he system faster if they review some past threat models. 

2) Shostack 2022

i) This is a threat modeling course by Adam Shoestack who has written a very famous book on threat modeling. According to him threat modeling should be done early on to anticipate problems like before any code has been written or chips being procured. Threat modeling is a package of methods that will help us to think about security beforehand. There are four questions and if we focus on these we are threat modeling
 
- What are we working on?
- What can go or what could possibly go wrong?
- What are we gonna do about it?
- Did we did a good job?

ii) Sketching on the other hand is the beginning part of answering the questions what are we working on as we put thoughts out of our heads and discuss it with others. Using a drawing a tool might be beneficial. This all helps to answer "what could possibly go wrong?" 

iii) Data flow diagrams are simple to draw and help us understanding "what are we working on?". Answer the questions the heart of threat modeling "What could go wrong" if one takes guidance using Stride it might be easier. Structure is important for consistency and for that we use STRIDE to answer what could go wrong. 

iv) Tracking is important as each threat could be countered by the answers of the question "What are we gonna do about it". Risk management is utilized for analysing subset of threats and helping us to decide what are we going to do about those. Last question "did we do a good job", is there so we know that work was actually done and it was worth our time. 

3) OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021

i) Threat modeling is strcutured, and it focuses on analsying how might a system be attacked. It should be done early in the SDLC and as a normal step in the process. 

ii) Advantages of threat modeling are Identify risks early, increase security and have a better understanding of the system. 

iii) Each of the four questions should be answered and looked in depth by using tools. Stride can be used to identify the threat, "what can go wrong". Response and migitation is the section to think and decide what to do about each threat. Last but not least Review and Validation where we check if the work is good enough. 

iv) Cloud systems might introduce new challenges. Clooud frameworks for example, "AWS’s Well-Architected Framework – Security Pillar " might help. 

Idea: Threat modeling could be used like a checklist that is revisited at every design change in a system.
