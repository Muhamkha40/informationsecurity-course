2) Shostack 2022

i) This is a threat modeling course by Adam Shoestack who has written a very famous book on threat modeling. According to him threat modeling should be done early on to anticipate problems like before any code has been written or chips being procured. 

ii) Threat modeling is a package of methods that will help us to think about security beforehand. There are four questions and if we focus on these we are threat modeling
 
- What are we working on?
- What can go or what could possibly go wrong?
- What are we gonna do about it?
- Did we did a good job?

iii) Sketching on the other hand is the beginning part of answering the questions what are we working on as we put thoughts out of our heads and discuss it with others. Using a drawing a tool might be beneficial. This all helps to answer "what could possibly go wrong?" 

iv) Data flow diagrams are simple to draw and help us understanding "what are we working on?".
